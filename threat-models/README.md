##  Key Threats & Countermeasures



### 1.  SIM Swap Attacks



- **Overview:**  

  SIM swapping is a type of account takeover fraud where attackers trick mobile providers into porting a victim’s phone number to a SIM card under their control. This lets them intercept OTPs (One-Time Passwords) and reset access to financial accounts.



- **Why It’s Critical in Africa:**  

  In many African countries, phone numbers are deeply tied to banking apps, national IDs, and mobile money wallets. The widespread use of **SMS-based authentication** makes fintech systems especially vulnerable.



- **Included Resources:**

  - [`sim-swap.md`](./sim-swap.md): English explanation of SIM swap mechanics and risks.

  - [`sim-swap_sw.md`](./sim-swap_sw.md): Swahili translation for regional accessibility.

### 2.  Phishing & Malicious IP Traffic



- **Overview:**  

  Phishing campaigns frequently originate from known IP ranges used to launch credential harvesting attacks or simulate login attempts.



- **Mitigation Strategy:**  

 A tailored IAM policy is used to deny access from known malicious IP addresses. While not a complete solution, this provides a valuable first layer of defense against phishing campaigns, especially those targeting fintech platforms across West Africa.


- **Included Files:**

  - [`phishing-ips-westafrica.csv`](./phishing-ips-westafrica.csv): Simulated list of high-risk IPs from West African phishing attempts.

  - [`FintechIPBlockPolicy_WestAfrica.json`](./FintechIPBlockPolicy_WestAfrica.json): AWS IAM policy to deny access from listed IPs.

##  Security Philosophy: Defense in Depth



These threat mitigation steps contribute to a **layered security posture**:



- **Primary Defenses:**  

  - Replace SMS with **app-based MFA** (e.g., Google Authenticator)  

  - Use device fingerprinting or biometrics where possible



- **Secondary Defenses:**  

  - Block IP ranges linked to fraud activity  

  - Monitor login patterns using **CloudTrail + GuardDuty**



Combining identity hardening with network level restrictions ensures a more resilient cloud based fintech stack.
