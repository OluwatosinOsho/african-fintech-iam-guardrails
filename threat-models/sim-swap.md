## SIM Swap Attacks: A Silent Threat to African Fintech

**SIM swap attack** is a growing cyber threat where scammers take over your phone number by tricking your mobile provider into moving it to a new SIM card they control. They usually gather your personal details through phishing links, fake customer support calls, or even by stalking your social media. Sometimes, they don’t need to fake anything, insiders at telecom companies or dormant number recycling can hand them access. Once your number is in their hands, they intercept OTPs, reset login credentials, and gain control of your bank apps, email, and even your crypto wallets.

This is a serious risk in **Africa’s fintech space**, especially in countries like **Nigeria**, where phone numbers are directly tied to financial services, digital wallets, and national ID systems. Most banks still rely on **SMS-based authentication**, which becomes useless once an attacker controls your line. Weak KYC checks at telcos, insider collusion, and low public awareness only make things worse. Until mobile operators tighten SIM swap processes and fintechs move to stronger login methods like biometrics or app-based tokens, this silent form of theft will keep costing users their money, and their identity. While stronger authentication methods are the definitive answer to SIM swaps, complementary controls like IP-based blocking can serve as a valuable first line of defense against associated phishing attempts and general unauthorized access.
