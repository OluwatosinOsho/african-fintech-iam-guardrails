# Automated Security Remediation with AWS Lambda

This directory focuses on building **automated remediation** mechanisms using **AWS Lambda** functions to enforce security and compliance in a FinTech cloud environment. Beyond just detecting misconfigurations, automated remediation enables "self healing" security, significantly reducing response times to potential threats and preserving a secure and compliant cloud environment

## Purpose of Automated Remediation

In a FinTech context, every second counts when dealing with security incidents. Automated remediation helps to:

- **Minimize Exposure Window:** Instantly correct non compliant configurations (e.g., public S3 buckets), drastically reducing the time sensitive data might be exposed.
- **Scalability:** Automatically apply security fixes across vast cloud infrastructures without manual intervention, which is critical for growing organizations.
- **Continuous Compliance:** Ensure that resources continuously adhere to defined security baselines and regulatory requirements.
- **Reduce Operational Overhead:** Free up security teams from repetitive manual remediation tasks, allowing them to focus on higher value activities.
- **Prevent Human Error:** Eliminate the possibility of human error during urgent security responses.

## Implemented Remediation Scenario: S3 Public Access Control

This section demonstrates a practical automated remediation solution for a common and critical security risk: unintended public access to S3 buckets.

### S3 Public Access Remediation Lambda

- **Description:** A Python based AWS Lambda function designed to automatically enable S3 Public Access Block settings on any S3 bucket that is detected as non-compliant (e.g., through an AWS Config rule).
- **Trigger Mechanism (Conceptual):** In a real world setup, this Lambda would be triggered by an AWS Config rule (e.g., `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`) when it detects a public S3 bucket.
- **Impact:** Ensures sensitive financial data stored in S3 remains private and adheres to strict confidentiality requirements.

- **Lambda Code:** [`s3_public_access_remediation_lambda.py`](./s3_public_access_remediation_lambda.py): The Python source code for the automated S3 remediation function.
- **Documentation:** [`s3-public-access-remediation-lambda.md`](./s3-public-access-remediation-lambda.md): Detailed explanation of the Lambda function, its logic, and its security implications.

## Future Automated Remediation Enhancements

- **MFA Enforcement:** Lambda to automatically attach MFA enforcement policies to IAM users who disable MFA.
- **Security Group Hardening:** Automatically remove overly permissive inbound rules (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 on sensitive ports).
- **Resource Tagging Enforcement:** Tagging non-compliant resources and potentially shutting down untagged resources after a grace period.
- **Orchestrated Remediation Workflows:** Use AWS Step Functions to create more complex, multi-step remediation processes.
