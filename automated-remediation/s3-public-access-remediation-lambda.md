# 🛡️ AWS Lambda for S3 Public Access Remediation

This document details an AWS Lambda function designed for **automated security remediation**, specifically targeting unintended public access to Amazon S3 buckets. In a **FinTech environment**, preventing public exposure of sensitive data is important, and **automated remediation** provides an immediate and scalable response to misconfigurations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This Lambda function acts as a **self healing mechanism** for S3 buckets, ensuring that any bucket unintentionally configured with public access is immediately secured. Its key purposes include:

### 🔒 Automated Risk Mitigation
Instantly revokes public access, minimizing exposure time for sensitive financial data

### ✅ Compliance Enforcement
Maintains continuous compliance with internal policies and external regulations (e.g., **GDPR**, **PCI DSS**) that prohibit public access to financial data.

### 📈 Scalability
Automatically remediates across potentially thousands of S3 buckets without manual intervention.

### 🧑‍💻 Reduced Human Error
Eliminates slow, error prone manual detection and remediation.

## 🧠 Lambda Function Overview

- **📄 File:** `s3_public_access_remediation_lambda.py`  
- **🧪 Runtime:** Python 3.9+  
- **📦 Dependencies:** `boto3` (pre-included in AWS Lambda)

💻 Python Code (Core Logic): [`s3_public_access_remediation_lambda.py`](./s3_public_access_remediation_lambda.py)

## 🔄 Real World Integration

### 🧭 Detection (AWS Config Rule)
Use built in or custom **AWS Config Rules** (e.g., `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`) to automatically detect buckets with **public access misconfigurations**.

### 📡 Event Trigger (CloudWatch / EventBridge)
When a bucket violates the compliance rule, AWS Config sends an event via **Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)**, which then triggers the remediation Lambda function.

### 🛠️ Remediation (Lambda)
The Lambda function receives the event and **programmatically enforces S3 public access blocks** on the offending bucket to secure it in real time.

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations (FinTech Context)

### 🔐 Data Confidentiality
Prevents **accidental public exposure** of regulated financial data by ensuring sensitive S3 buckets are immediately secured.

### 📋 Regulatory Compliance
Enforces policies aligned with **GDPR, PCI DSS**, and other FinTech compliance standards that mandate strict access controls.

### 🔍 Principle of Least Privilege
Ensure the Lambda execution role **only requires `s3:PutPublicAccessBlock`**, minimizing over permissioning.

### 📘 Auditability
All remediation actions are **logged in CloudWatch Logs**, supporting traceability, audit trails, and security incident reviews.

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

To deploy this solution in production:

### 📥 Create Lambda Function:
Upload `s3_public_access_remediation_lambda.py` into a new Lambda function.

### 🔐 Create IAM Role:
Ensure the role includes:

- `s3:PutPublicAccessBlock`
- Logging permissions for CloudWatch

### ⚙️ Configure AWS Config Rule:
Use rules like `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited` or create a custom rule.

### 📡 Connect EventBridge:
Route the non compliance event to trigger your remediation Lambda.
