# 🔍 External Access Review with AWS IAM Access Analyzer

This directory showcases the implementation of **AWS IAM Access Analyzer** to detect and mitigate **external access risks** in a FinTech cloud environment. In highly regulated industries like FinTech, controlling **who can access cloud resources from outside your AWS account or organization** is critical for maintaining **security, compliance, and audit readiness**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose: Why External Access Reviews Matter

AWS IAM Access Analyzer enables FinTech teams to:

- 🔐 **Proactively Identify Access Risks**  
  Scan policies attached to S3 buckets, IAM roles, KMS keys, SQS queues, and Secrets Manager to detect **unintended public or cross account access**.

- 🚫 **Prevent Data Exposure**  
  Minimize the risk of **data leaks or misconfigurations** that expose sensitive customer data.

- ✅ **Meet Compliance Requirements**  
  Supports mandates from **GDPR, PCI DSS, NDPR**, and local financial regulations by maintaining strict access controls.

- 📋 **Simplify Audits and Reviews**  
  Provides auditable logs and clear visibility into **external access policies**, aiding in security assessments and regulatory audits.

## ⚙️ Implementation Summary

This directory documents how IAM Access Analyzer was enabled and evaluated for the project:

### 1. 🔧 Service Enablement
- **Scope:** Account level analyzer enabled in `us-east-1`
- **Purpose:** Begin automatic scanning of resource policies for any sharing with external entities (public or cross account)

### 2. 📊 Initial Findings
- **Finding Count:** `0`  
- **Security Implication:** No immediate external access detected, a strong default security baseline.

*(If findings had been present, we would document them in detail along with remediation steps.)*
