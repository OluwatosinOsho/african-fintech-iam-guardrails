#  IAM Access Analyzer: External Access Review

This document outlines the **setup, benefits, and initial scan results** of enabling **AWS IAM Access Analyzer** as part of the `African Fintech IAM Guardrails` project. This tool is essential for identifying cloud resources, like **S3 buckets, IAM roles, SQS queues, KMS keys, and Secrets Manager secrets**, that may be  unintentionally exposed to **unauthorized or third-party identities** outside your AWS account or organization.

##  Purpose of IAM Access Analyzer in FinTech

In a FinTech context, where **customer data, financial records, and critical infrastructure** reside in the cloud, **unauthorized and third-party access detection** becomes absolutely essential. IAM Access Analyzer supports:

-  **Detection of Public and Cross-Account Access**  
  Automatically scans resource-based policies for permissions granted to principals outside your AWS account or AWS Organization.

-  **Prevention of Data Leaks**  
  Flags unintended exposure to help mitigate risk before breaches occur.

-  **Compliance with Regulatory Standards**  
  Assists with meeting controls in **GDPR**, **NDPR**, **PCI DSS**, and other FinTech compliance frameworks.

-  **Audit and Security Visibility**  
  Delivers real time visibility into which AWS resources are accessible outside your trusted account or organization.
