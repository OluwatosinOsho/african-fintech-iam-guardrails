# 🔐 AI-Powered Policy Drafting for Secure Data Ingestion

This document showcases the application of **Generative AI (Google Gemini)** in drafting a complex AWS S3 bucket policy. For a FinTech startup, leveraging AI for initial policy generation significantly accelerates development, minimizes human error, and ensures compliance with stringent security and compliance requirements.

## 🎯 Use Case: Secure Data Ingestion to Amazon S3

FinTech applications frequently handle highly sensitive customer and transaction data. Ingesting this data into Amazon S3 must follow strict controls, including:

- **Data Encryption at Rest** (e.g., SSE-KMS)
- **Secure Data Transport** (enforced HTTPS)
- **Granular Access Control** (IAM role-based and IP-restricted)

Manually crafting such policies is tedious, time consuming, and prone to human error, especially under tight compliance constraints.

## 🤖 AI Prompt and Requirements

The following detailed prompt was provided to **Google Gemini**, acting as an “AWS IAM policy expert,” to generate the bucket policy:

> As an AWS IAM policy expert for a FinTech startup, draft an AWS S3 **bucket policy** (not an IAM user/role policy) that meets the following requirements:
>
> - **Actions Allowed**: Only `s3:PutObject` and `s3:DeleteObject`
> - **Target Bucket**: `fintech-secure-data-ingestion-2025` and its objects
> - **Principal**: IAM Role `arn:aws:iam::535537926792:role/FintechDataIngestionRole`
> - **Encryption**: PUT operations must use **SSE-KMS** with key ID `arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:535537926792:key/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee` and include the header `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`
> - **Transport**: HTTPS-only (`aws:SecureTransport`)
> - **IP Restriction**: Only allow access from:
>   - `192.168.1.0/24`
>   - `10.0.0.10/32`

| **IAM Role Restriction**         | Access granted only to the specified role `FintechDataIngestionRole`                   |
| **Encryption Enforcement**       | Requires SSE-KMS with a specific KMS Key ID for uploads                                |
| **Secure Transport (TLS)**       | Ensures all access uses HTTPS (`aws:SecureTransport = true`)                           |
